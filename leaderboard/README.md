• Files stored in a “private” folder will only be accessible to code that’s executed on the
server. These files will never be accessible to users.
• Files stored in a “public” folder are served to visitors. These are files like images, favicons,
and the “robots.txt” file.
• Files stored in a “lib” folder are loaded before other files.
